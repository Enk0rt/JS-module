**Hello, this is my app created for entering and managing a list of name/value pairs**


**Technologies used in this project:**
- HTML
- CSS
- JS


**Main features of the app:**
- Very easy entering the name/value pair to the list. Everything, including spaces, that is before "=" sign is the "Name" and everything that is after - is "Value"
- The pais validates after entering and if it contains any symbol like ".<>?!" or it doesn`t contain any "=" sign, or it has more then one "=" etc. it is not validated, so the user gets alert asking him to re-enter his pair
- Opportunity to sort current list by Name or Value
- User can choose which pair should be deleted by pressing the "delete" button
- Progress saves after page reload
- UI is adaptive to various devises with extra-small, small, medium size screens and dektop devices
